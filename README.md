I have been developing for iOS on Swift for a little over a year. Before mobile I was interested in web-dev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Strong knowledge of Xcode, Swift, can write simple stuff in Objective-C. I'm an Exercism and open-source contributor. I use Kanban and GTDs for personal management, there will be no problems with this. I'm fluent in English (most of my learning was in English) and Russian and can read in Polish (my dad from Poland).  
  
Professional background: video editing and management.
